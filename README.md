EverRest: An RFduino based wearable device used to help in the diagnosis of sleep apnea

An RFduino, connected to the MYOware muscle sensor, monitors muscle patterns and sends this to a secondary RFduino, which is plugged into a computer and saves the data. 
This data can then be analyzed by a medical professional.
