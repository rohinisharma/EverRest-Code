# EverRest-Code

EverRest: An RFduino based low-cost wearable device used to help in the diagnosis of sleep apnea without needing sleep studies or complex devices.

An RFduino microcontroller, connected to the MYOware muscle sensor, monitors muscle patterns and sends this to a secondary RFduino, which is plugged into a computer and saves the data.  
This data can then be plotted and analyzed by a medical professional, to view a patient's breathing patterns and aid in the diagnosis of sleap apnea.
